# The D-PLACE Cookbook

Recipes for cooking with [D-PLACE data](https://github.com/d-place/dplace-data/releases).


## Accessing D-PLACE data

### Overview

D-PLACE data can be accessed in a variety of ways.

- It can be browsed and visualized in the [D-PLACE web application](https://d-place.org).
- Released versions of the data can be downloaded from [ZENODO](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596376).
- The [D-PLACE data repository on GitHub](https://github.com/d-place/dplace-data) can be forked and cloned, thus getting access to released version as well as work-in-progress.

Which of these options to choose?

- If you want to get an overview of the kind an extent of data available in D-PLACE, browse the [D-PLACE web application](https://d-place.org).
- If you want to use D-PLACE data for your own analyses, start with a released version from ZENODO.
- If you want to contribute to D-PLACE - e.g. to fix errata - fork and clone the data repository.


### Working with the "raw" data

Both ZENODO downloads and the GitHub repository give you access to the "raw" data, i.e. the data, split into multiple directories and (mostly CSV) files, and generally organized in a way most suitable for data curation. While aggregated subsets of this data may be easier to work with - e.g. the data as aggregated by the web app is easier to browse than the files in the filesystem - starting your work from the "raw" data should still be simple enough. The recipes in this cookbook are meant to help with this.
